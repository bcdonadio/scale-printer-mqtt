# GitHub Actions Workflow Execution Truth Table

This table shows which steps execute on which platforms for different trigger events.

## Legend
- ✅ = Step executes on this platform
- ❌ = Step does not execute on this platform
- Event types:
  - `push_master`: Push to master branch
  - `pull_request`: Pull request events
  - `merge_group`: Merge group events
  - `release`: Release published
  - `workflow_dispatch_*`: Manual workflow dispatch with different platform selections
