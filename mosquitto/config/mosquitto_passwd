# This is a placeholder password file for Mosquitto.
# It needs to be generated correctly using mosquitto_passwd.
# For example:
#   mosquitto_passwd -c -b /path/to/mosquitto_passwd scale_user scale_password
#   mosquitto_passwd -b /path/to/mosquitto_passwd printer_user printer_password
#
# The content below is NOT in the correct encrypted format and is for illustration.
# Replace with actual encrypted content.
#
# scale_user:$7$101$... (encrypted form of scale_password)
# printer_user:$7$101$... (encrypted form of printer_password)

# For the purpose of having a file, and assuming the test Mosquitto might be
# configured to accept plain text passwords (not default or recommended for real use),
# or that the actual test setup will replace this file:
scale_user:scale_password
printer_user:printer_password
